# Customer-segmentation-via-K-means
To become more profitable, you need to be able to differentiate your customers to more effectively satisfy the needs of the different segments. But how do you segment your customers ? The answer lies in this notebook !  Even if you have a highly-targeted customer demographic in your business, there are still variations between individual customers. Recognising these differences will allow you to tailor your approach to the needs of varying customer segments and allow you to effectively serve a wider group of people.
## What is Customer Segmentation?

Customer segmentation is the practice of **dividing a customer base into groups of individuals that are similar in specific ways**. You can provide different value propositions to different customer groups. Customer segments are usually **determined on similarities**, such as personal characteristics, preferences or behaviours that should correlate with the same behaviours that drive customer profitability.

A customer segmentation model allows for the **effective allocation of marketing resources** and the maximisation of cross and up-selling opportunities. When a group of customers is sent an email that is specific to their needs, itâ€™s easier for companies to send those customers special offers.

Other benefits of customer segmentation include staying a step ahead of the competition and identifying new products that existing or potential customers could be interested in.
